# Content Localization

> **Cloudera AI Workbench:** For automated AMP deployment with local NIM inference on Ray, see [cai/README.md](cai/README.md).
>
> **Docker Hub:** Build and push the unified image with `docker build -t <user>/content-localization:latest .` — see [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).

The Content Localization Blueprint is a comprehensive solution for translating and dubbing audio and video content using AI services. It is a microservices architecture that orchestrates three main AI services:

- **Speech-to-Speech (S2S)**: Translates audio from one language to another with voice preservation
- **Speaker Detection (ASD NIM)**: Identifies who needs to be dubbed in the video
- **LipSync**: Synchronizes lip movements with translated audio

The blueprint supports multiple client types to accommodate different deployment scenarios and use-case requirements.

Note: To get access to the LipSync feature of the Content localization Blueprint, please request to join our [NVIDIA AI for Media Private Access Program](https://developer.nvidia.com/ai-for-media/private-access-program)

## Overall Architecture

The diagram below shows the controller-centric end-to-end architecture used to orchestrate S2S, ASD, and LipSync workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the development environment, ensure you have the following installed:

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04 recommended)
- **Python**: 3.12 or higher
- **Git**: With Git LFS enabled
- **NVIDIA GPU**: With CUDA-capable drivers installed
- **CUDA Toolkit**: CUDA 12.x
- **TensorRT**: Compatible with your CUDA version
- **Docker**: Docker Engine 24.x or higher with Docker Compose and NVIDIA Docker runtime.
- **Node.js/npm**: Node 24 (Optional, only for UI development and pre-commit hooks)

### Verify GPU and CUDA Installation

```bash
# Verify NVIDIA driver installation
nvidia-smi

# Check CUDA version
nvcc --version
```
**Note**: If `nvcc` is not found, ensure CUDA is properly installed and added to your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH

### Install System Dependencies

**Note**: This project will download and install additional third-party open source software projects. Review the license terms of these open source projects before use.

These packages are required:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    wget \
    git-lfs
```

### Required Credentials

You need the following credentials set as environment variables (or in a `.env` file).
Get your NGC API keys from: https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-key

**NIM container keys** — `docker-compose.yml` maps these component-specific keys to
`NGC_API_KEY` inside each NIM container. Set the keys for the services you intend to run:

| Variable | Used by | When required |
|---|---|---|
| `LIPSYNC_API_KEY` | LipSync NIM container | When using Lipsync |
| `ASD_API_KEY` | ASD NIM container | When using Active Speaker Detection |

**Third-party API keys** — required only when using the corresponding S2S backend:

| Variable | When required |
|---|---|
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | When `S2S_SERVICE=EL_DUBBING` |
| `CAMB_API_KEY` | When `S2S_SERVICE=CAMB_DUBBING` (and for the CAMB.AI helper scripts) |
---

## Development Environment Setup

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your credentials:

```bash
# .env file

# NIM container keys (mapped to NGC_API_KEY inside each container by docker-compose.yml)
LIPSYNC_API_KEY=your_ngc_api_key_here
ASD_API_KEY=your_ngc_api_key_here

# Third-party S2S backend keys
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_11labs_api_key_here
# CAMB_API_KEY=your_camb_api_key_here

PYTHONPATH=path-to-root-of-repository
```

### 2. Install uv Package Manager

Install `uv`, the fast Python package manager:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Add `uv` to your PATH (or restart your shell):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### 3. Create Virtual Environment

Create and activate a Python 3.12 virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Python Dependencies

Install the project dependencies and commonly used extras:

```bash
# Install core dependencies with non-GPU extras (test, lint, docs)
uv sync --extra test --extra lint --extra docs
```

Install GPU extras only on hosts with CUDA Toolkit headers available (`cuda.h`):

```bash
# Optional: install GPU extras (requires CUDA Toolkit development headers)
uv sync --extra gpu
```

### 5. Generate Protocol Buffer Files

Generate Python code from the gRPC/protobuf definitions:

```bash
# Download gRPC health check proto
wget -O protos/health.proto https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grpc/grpc/master/src/proto/grpc/health/v1/health.proto

# Generate Python protobuf files
bash ./protos/generate_protos.sh
```

### 6. Install Development Tools

Install linting and pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Install development tools
uv tool install pre-commit
uv tool install ruff

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

To update pre-commit hook versions (optional):

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```

To run pre-commit on all files manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 7. Set Python Path

Add the project root, `src`, `client`, and generated protobuf files to your `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${PWD}:${PWD}/src:${PWD}/client:${PWD}/protos/generated"
```

Add this line to your shell profile (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) to make it permanent:

```bash
echo 'export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:'"${PWD}"':'"${PWD}"'/src:'"${PWD}"'/client:'"${PWD}"'/protos/generated"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 8. Create Required Directories

Create the directories for test outputs, builds, and the NIM model caches:

```bash
mkdir -p build outputs volumes/models/asd volumes/models/lipsync
```

The ASD and LipSync NIM services download their models into the bind-mounted
cache directories (`volumes/models/asd` and `volumes/models/lipsync`). On a
fresh clone these directories must already **exist** — they ship with a
`.gitkeep` placeholder — otherwise `docker compose up` fails with
`Permission denied (os error 13)` when Docker cannot resolve the mount path.

The NIM containers run as `root`, so they can write into these directories once
they exist. Ensure the `volumes`, `build`, and `outputs` trees are writable by
your host user and group (no world-writable `777` needed):

```bash
chmod -R u+rwX,g+rwX volumes build outputs
```

### 9. Deploy and Verify Services (First-Time Setup)

For first-time deployment, use the deploy scripts to verify each service individually. This approach downloads models and verifies that each service starts correctly before deploying the full stack.

#### Deploy ASD Service

Deploy the Active Speaker Detection service:

```bash
./scripts/nims/deploy_asd.sh
```

This will:
- Download the ASD model to `volumes/models/asd/`
- Start the ASD container on ports 8005 (HTTP) and 50055 (gRPC)
- Verify the service is running correctly

**Note**: Model download may take several minutes depending on your internet connection. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the service once verified.

#### Deploy LipSync Service

Deploy the LipSync service:

```bash
./scripts/nims/deploy_lipsync.sh
```

This will:
- Download the LipSync models to `volumes/models/lipsync/`
- Start the LipSync container on ports 8004 (HTTP) and 50054 (gRPC)
- Verify the service is running correctly

**Note**: This requires the `LIPSYNC_API_KEY` (or `NGC_API_KEY`) environment variable. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the service once verified.

#### Deployment Notes

- Each deploy script runs in interactive mode (`-it`) and will occupy your terminal
- Run each script in a separate terminal or stop (Ctrl+C) before running the next
- These scripts are for **verification only** - use docker compose for production deployments

### 10. Verify Setup

If all steps completed successfully, you're ready to run the full service stack!

To verify your setup:
1. All deploy scripts should have started successfully without errors
2. Model files should be present in `volumes/models/` subdirectories
3. TensorRT engines should be built in `volumes/models/asd/`

You can now proceed to [Running the Services](#running-the-services) to launch the full stack with docker compose.

---

## Running the Services

### Launch All Services

Start the full Content Localization stack:

```bash
# Full stack: S2S (ElevenLabs/CambAI) + ASD + LipSync + Controller + Demo App
docker compose --profile demo-app-third-party-s2s \
    --env-file configs/elevenlabs.env \
    --env-file .env \
    up --build
```

### Available Profiles

Different service combinations for various use cases. Use the `--profile` flag to select which services to run.
The canonical profile reference lives in [docs/source/deployment.rst](docs/source/deployment.rst).

| Profile | S2S | ASD | LipSync | Controller | Demo App | Description |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|------------|----------|-------------|
| `default` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | All services (for testing) |
| `third-party-s2s` | ✓ | - | - | - | - | S2S only with ElevenLabs/CambAI |
| `lipsync` | ✓ | - | ✓ | - | - | LipSync + S2S backend |
| `third-party-s2s-lipsync` | ✓ | - | ✓ | - | - | S2S (ElevenLabs/CambAI) + LipSync |
| `third-party-s2s-asd-lipsync` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | - | - | Full pipeline with ElevenLabs/CambAI |
| `asd` | - | ✓ | - | - | - | Active Speaker Detection only |
| `controller-third-party-s2s` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | - | Orchestrated pipeline (ElevenLabs/CambAI) |
| `asd-lipsync` | - | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | - | ASD + LipSync + Controller |
| `demo-app-third-party-s2s` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Full stack with Web Demo (ElevenLabs/CambAI) |

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# ElevenLabs with full pipeline and demo app
docker compose --profile demo-app-third-party-s2s \
    --env-file configs/elevenlabs.env \
    --env-file .env \
    up --build

# CambAI S2S + ASD + LipSync (no controller, no demo)
docker compose --profile third-party-s2s-asd-lipsync \
    --env-file configs/camb.env \
    --env-file .env \
    up --build

# Controller orchestration with ElevenLabs (also similar for camb)
docker compose --profile controller-third-party-s2s \
    --env-file configs/elevenlabs.env \
    --env-file .env \
    up --build

# Basic S2S with ElevenLabs only (also similar for CambAI)
docker compose --profile third-party-s2s \
    --env-file configs/elevenlabs.env \
    --env-file .env \
    up --build
```

#### Profile Selection Guide

- **For Development/Testing**: Use `demo-app-third-party-s2s` for the full stack with web interface
- **For Production with ElevenLabs/CambAI**: Use `controller-third-party-s2s` for orchestrated processing
- **For Service Testing**: Use individual profiles like `third-party-s2s`, `lipsync`, or `asd`

### Stop Services

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clean state)
docker compose down -v
```

### View Logs

#### Real-Time Log Viewing

View logs in real-time as services are running:

```bash
# View logs from all services (follow mode)
docker compose logs -f

# View logs from specific service
docker compose logs -f speech-to-speech
docker compose logs -f asd
docker compose logs -f controller
docker compose logs -f lipsync

# View logs from multiple services
docker compose logs -f speech-to-speech controller

# View last 100 lines of logs
docker compose logs --tail=100
```

#### Copy Logs to Files

For debugging or sharing, use the log copy script to save logs to local files:

```bash
# Copy logs from all services to ./logs/ directory
./scripts/misc/copy_docker_logs.sh

# Copy logs from a specific service only
./scripts/misc/copy_docker_logs.sh s2s
./scripts/misc/copy_docker_logs.sh lipsync
./scripts/misc/copy_docker_logs.sh asd
./scripts/misc/copy_docker_logs.sh controller

# View help
./scripts/misc/copy_docker_logs.sh --help
```

This creates log files in `./logs/`:
- `./logs/s2s.log` - Speech-to-Speech service logs
- `./logs/lipsync.log` - LipSync service logs
- `./logs/asd.log` - Active Speaker Detection logs
- `./logs/controller.log` - Controller orchestration logs

**Benefits of copying logs**:
- Persist logs even after containers are stopped
- Easy to share with team members for debugging
- Can be archived or uploaded to issue trackers
- Includes line counts and helpful status messages

### Regenerate Protocol Buffers

gRPC protobuf definitions are in the `protos/` folder. To regenerate:

```bash
cd protos
bash generate_protos.sh
cd ..
```

### Code Formatting and Linting

The project uses `ruff` for code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Check formatting
ruff format --check src/ tests/ client/

# Auto-format code
ruff format src/ tests/ client/

# Run linter
ruff check src/ tests/ client/

# Auto-fix linting issues
ruff check --fix src/ tests/ client/
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automatically on each commit:

```bash
# Run manually on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Skip hooks (not recommended)
git commit --no-verify
```

---

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_s2s_service.py

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_asd"
```

### Test Coverage

Coverage reports are generated in `build/coverage/`:

```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov-report html:build/coverage

# Open coverage report
open build/coverage/index.html  # macOS
xdg-open build/coverage/index.html  # Linux
```

### Functional Tests

Comprehensive end-to-end functional tests are available to validate the complete pipeline with all clients and services. These tests run actual clients with sample inputs and verify outputs.

**Test Coverage:**
- Controller Client (orchestrated pipeline)
- Direct Client (direct service communication)
- S2S Client (audio translation with latency analysis)
- LipSync Client (lip synchronization)
- ASD Client (active speaker detection)

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Run all functional tests
python -m pytest functional_tests/ -v

# Run specific client tests
python -m pytest functional_tests/test_controller_client.py -v
python -m pytest functional_tests/test_s2s_client.py -v
```

> **CambAI stacks:** the defaults use ElevenLabs-style language codes
> (`en`, `es`). CambAI expects integer language IDs, so pass them explicitly,
> otherwise the run fails with `Invalid CambAI source language ID: en`:
>
> ```bash
> source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest functional_tests/ -v --require-services \
>     --source-language 1 --target-language 54
> ```

**Prerequisites:**
- All services running (S2S, ASD, LipSync, Controller)
- Sample input files in `assets/`
- Python environment with dependencies

### Diarization Scripts

These scripts generate diarization data (speaker segmentation) from audio files, producing JSON files that can be passed to the ASD client or Controller client via `--diarization-file`.

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/elevenlabs/diarize.py` | Generate diarization using ElevenLabs Scribe STT | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<key> python scripts/elevenlabs/diarize.py --input-file audio.wav` |
| `scripts/camb/diarize.py` | Generate source-language diarization using Camb AI | `CAMB_API_KEY=<key> python scripts/camb/diarize.py --input-file audio.wav` |

#### scripts/elevenlabs/diarize.py

Generate diarization data using the ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text (Scribe) API. Outputs native ElevenLabs STT JSON format.

**Usage:**
```bash
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<key> python scripts/elevenlabs/diarize.py \
    --input-file audio.wav \
    --output-file diarization.json
```

**Arguments:**
- `--input-file` - Path to audio file (WAV, MP3, etc.) (required)
- `--output-file` - Path to output JSON file (default: `diarization.json`)
- `--language-code` - Language code (default: auto-detect)
- `--max-speakers` - Maximum number of speakers (default: model default)
- `--model-id` - Scribe model ID (default: `scribe_v2`)
- `--tag-audio-events` - Tag audio events such as (laughter) or (footsteps) in the transcript (flag, default off)

**Requirements:**
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` environment variable

### Standalone Dubbing Scripts

These scripts perform end-to-end dubbing outside of the gRPC service pipeline, using cloud dubbing APIs directly.

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/elevenlabs/s2s_infer.py` | ElevenLabs end-to-end dubbing | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<key> python scripts/elevenlabs/s2s_infer.py --input-file assets/sample_audio.wav --source-language-code en --target-language-code es -o output.wav` |
| `scripts/camb/s2s_infer.py` | CAMB end-to-end dubbing | `CAMB_API_KEY=<key> python scripts/camb/s2s_infer.py --input-file assets/sample_audio.wav --source-language 1 --target-language 54 -o output.mp3` |
| `scripts/elevenlabs/invoke_e2e.sh` | Wrapper for ElevenLabs E2E dubbing | `./scripts/elevenlabs/invoke_e2e.sh` |
| `scripts/camb/invoke_e2e.sh` | Wrapper for CAMB E2E dubbing | `./scripts/camb/invoke_e2e.sh` |

#### scripts/elevenlabs/s2s_infer.py

Invoke ElevenLabs end-to-end dubbing for local media files. Extracts audio from video, submits a dubbing request, and downloads the translated audio.

**Usage:**
```bash
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<key> python scripts/elevenlabs/s2s_infer.py \
    --input-file assets/sample_audio.wav \
    --source-language-code en \
    --target-language-code es \
    --output-file output.wav \
    --source-transcript-output-file source_transcript.json \
    --target-transcript-output-file target_transcript.json \
    --transcript-format json
```

Transcript outputs are optional. ElevenLabs supports `json`, `srt`, and `webvtt` formats;
`vtt` is accepted as an alias for `webvtt`. Use ElevenLabs Dubbing API JSON outputs
as ASD, Controller, or Direct diarization inputs with
`--diarization-format elevenlabs-dubbing-api`. See
[docs/source/diarization_formats.rst](docs/source/diarization_formats.rst) for the
full list of supported diarization formats and their schemas.

**Requirements:**
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` environment variable
- `ffmpeg` installed (for video-to-audio extraction)

#### scripts/camb/s2s_infer.py

Invoke CAMB end-to-end dubbing for a local file or a public media URL. Submits a dubbing request, polls for completion, and downloads the translated audio. Pass exactly one of `--input-file` (uploaded via CAMB's `/files/upload-url` endpoint, requires the Files API to be enabled on your CAMB account) or `--input-url` (public media URL sent as `video_url`).

CAMB.AI uses **integer language IDs** (e.g. `1` = English, `54` = Spanish). To get the full mapping, query the CambAI API or see the [source languages](https://docs.camb.ai/api-reference/endpoint/get-source-languages) and [target languages](https://docs.camb.ai/api-reference/endpoint/get-target-languages) docs.

**Usage:**
```bash
CAMB_API_KEY=<key> python scripts/camb/s2s_infer.py \
    --input-file assets/sample_audio.wav \
    --source-language 1 \
    --target-language 54 \
    --output-file output.mp3 \
    --target-transcript-output-file target_transcript.json \
    --transcript-format json
```

Transcript outputs are optional and are always in the **target** language —
CAMB's dubbing API does not return a source-language transcript. JSON
writes the target-language diarized transcript from the `dub-result`
payload, and `txt`, `srt`, and `vtt` come from CAMB's formatted transcript
endpoint (also keyed on the target language). These can be passed to
clients with `--diarization-format camb` when target-language diarization
is acceptable. For source-language CAMB diarization (e.g. as ASD input),
use `scripts/camb/diarize.py` (Camb AI Transcription API).

**Requirements:**
- `CAMB_API_KEY` environment variable

#### deploy_asd.sh

Deploy the Active Speaker Detection (ASD) NIM container for standalone testing.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/nims/deploy_asd.sh
```

**Features:**
- Deploys ASD NIM container with GPU support
- Configures ports: HTTP (`ASD_NIM_HTTP_API_PORT`, default 8005) and gRPC (`ASD_GRPC_API_PORT`, default 50055)
- Mounts model cache at `volumes/models/asd/`
- Requires `ASD_API_KEY` environment variable
